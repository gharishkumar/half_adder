# Half Adder AXI Master-Slave Verilog Project

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a half adder with AXI4-Stream master-slave interfaces. The project includes the RTL design and a testbench for simulation and verification.

## Overview

The `half_adder_axi_master_slave` module implements a half adder with AXI4-Stream interfaces for communication between a master and a slave. The module takes two 1-bit inputs (`s_a_tdata` and `s_b_tdata`) and produces two 1-bit outputs (`m_sum_tdata` and `m_carry_tdata`). The design is verified using a Verilog testbench.  
I tried to be compliant with Advanced eXtensible Interface 4 stream (AXI4 - stream) protocol, yeah I really tried.

## Prerequisites

To simulate and test the Verilog code, you need the following tools:

1. **Verilog Simulator**:
   - [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) (Open-source)
   - [ModelSim](https://www.mentor.com/products/fpga/modelSim/) (Commercial)
   - [Xilinx Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html) (Commercial)
   - [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator) (Open-source)

2. **Waveform Viewer** (Optional):
   - [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) (Open-source)

3. **Git** (Optional):
   - To clone this repository.

## Simulation Steps

Follow these steps to simulate and verify the design:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghrishkumar/half_adder.git
cd half_adder_axi_master_slave
```

### Step 2: Create work library, Compile the Design and Testbench
Using QuestaSim:
```bash
vlib work
vlog -work work rtl/half_adder_axi_master_slave.v tb/tb_half_adder_axi_master_slave.v
```

### Step 3: Run the Simulation
Execute the compiled simulation:
```bash
vsim -voptargs=+acc work.tb_half_adder_axi_master_slave
```
```tcl
add_wave
run -all
```

### Step 4: View the Results
The simulation will print the test results in the terminal. If using a waveform viewer like GTKWave, you can generate a VCD file and view the waveforms:

Modify the testbench to include $dumpfile("waveform.vcd"); and $dumpvars; at the beginning of the initial block.

Recompile and run the simulation.

Open the waveform.vcd file in GTKWave:

```bash
gtkwave waveform.vcd
```

#### Expected Results
The testbench runs four test cases:

A = 0, B = 0: Sum = 0, Carry = 0

A = 1, B = 0: Sum = 1, Carry = 0

A = 0, B = 1: Sum = 1, Carry = 0

A = 1, B = 1: Sum = 0, Carry = 1

#### The simulation output should display:

Test case 1 passed: Sum = 0, Carry = 0  
Test case 2 passed: Sum = 1, Carry = 0  
Test case 3 passed: Sum = 1, Carry = 0  
Test case 4 passed: Sum = 0, Carry = 1  
Simulation completed.
